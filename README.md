#What is this?
See description

#How to use this?
1. Install Selenium and Chrome Webdriver
2. Put Chrome Webdriver's executable path in the path variable.
3. Sit back and run the script and curse this year's competition ;(
> 4. (Optional) Print to the console or use Pandas library to import this to a python list or whatever to sort it according to the rank.
> I have a sorted version, let me know if you want

#Why made this?
Many people wanted to see the Marks vs Rank data for this year's PUMEET, so...
Also this is me getting bored
